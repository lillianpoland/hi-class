The website shows the motion by slowly flipping the second matrix on its side to align with the values that will be multiplied. You then add the different products that you have gotten. It's important that the number of rows must match the number of columns because you are pairing elements from the first and second matrices. To visualize it, it would be like (A1**B1) + (A2*B2) + (A3*B3)... = your answer."
